Initial level commitment (80%, 90%, or 100%):
100% 

Tutorial time that at least one and ideally all members will guarantee to attend
each week: T1C 3pm Tuesday.

3+ hours weekly that the group guarantees EACH OTHER to be available
to meet (ideally face-to-face): yes
Tuesday and Thursday at 3:40pm to 5:10pm

Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project. Note:
Each idea should be plausible enough to show that the group has done
some thought and reading about it. Each should have the potential to
develop into a real project. Together, they should explore some
meaningfully distinct project options (so, not just three variations
on the same project).

1. Basic GraphQL API in Elixir with Phoenix. Any API for some basic purpose (UBC Grade data, Vancouver housing prices, Famous quotes), made with Phoenix (Elixir web framework)

2. Build a Redis-inspired key-value store in Rust. The program would have the safety benifits of Rust and the speed of C

3. Make a DSL for pattern matching in jq. jq is a command line tool for parsing JSON, with a really poorly designed pattern matching language. We would implement a DSL for replacing this pattern matching.
